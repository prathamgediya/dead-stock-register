# Online Dead Stock Register (ODSR)

A modern, secure, and efficient web application designed to replace traditional handwritten dead stock registers. This system automates inventory record-keeping by extracting data directly from uploaded bill documents, providing real-time access to authorized users across an organization.

## üöÄ The Problem & Our Solution

**The Problem:** Managing dead stock (permanent, non-consumable assets) using handwritten registers is prone to:
- **Manual Errors:** Human error in data entry leads to inaccurate records.
- **Inefficiency:** The process of writing, updating, and searching logs is slow and tedious.
- **Poor Accessibility:** Physical registers are available in only one location at a time.
- **Security Risks:** Paper records are vulnerable to damage, loss, and unauthorized access.
- **Cumbersome Reporting:** Generating audit reports or summaries requires manual compilation.

**Our Solution:** The Online Dead Stock Register is a web-based platform that:
- **Automates Data Entry:** Automatically populates inventory records by parsing data from digital bills upon upload.
- **Centralizes Data:** Provides a single source of truth for all dead stock inventory, accessible from anywhere.
- **Enhances Security:** Implements user authentication and role-based access control to protect sensitive data.
- **Improves Reporting:** Offers built-in tools for generating accurate and real-time reports instantly.
- **Boosts Efficiency:** Drastically reduces manual work, minimizes errors, and saves valuable time.
